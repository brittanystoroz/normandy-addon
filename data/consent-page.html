          <h2>What will happen next</h2>
          <p><strong>If you agree</strong> to participate:</p>
          <ol>
          <li>We install <strong class="addonName"></strong>, an add-on that will make the Firefox browser more personal to your usage patterns.</li>
          <li>Continue using Firefox as you normally would. You may notice changes.</li>
          <li>After <span class="duration"></span>, the study will end on its own. Your Firefox will go back to normal.</li>
          <li>We will ask you to fill out a quick <strong>optional survey</strong> to tell us about your experience. The survey should take less than 5 minutes to complete.</li>
          </ol>
          <h2>Leaving the study</h2>
          <p>The study will expire on its own in <span class="duration"></span>.  You may leave the study early.  To do so, follow these steps:</p>
          <ol>
          <li>Type <code>about:addons</code> into the location bar, and press enter.</li>
          <li>Find <strong class="addonName"></strong> in the <strong>extensions</strong> list pane.</li>
          <li>Click the <code>remove</code> button.</li>
          <li>If you opt out of the study early we will ask you to fill out a survey. We’re interested in hearing about your experience, even if you didn’t participate in the entire study.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Opting out of a study does not prevent you from participating in future studies.</p>
          <h2>Your privacy</h2>
          <h3>All Shield Studies</h3>
          <p>Every Shield Study collects data about important study events, such as install, uninstall, daily usage, and end of study. Studies also include an optional survey.</p>
          <p>This data is associated with <a href="https://gecko.readthedocs.io/en/latest/toolkit/components/telemetry/telemetry/index.html">Firefox Telemetry collection</a>.</p>
          <h3>This Particular Study</h3>
          <p>In addition to the data collected by all Shield Studies and your voluntary answers to the followup survey, here are the <strong>key things you should know</strong> about what is happening when you participate in this study:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>We collect basic usage data regarding your interaction with the experimental add-on.</li>
          <li>We collect data around your visits to <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/addon-recommendation-shield-study/blob/master/sites.txt">certain popular websites</a> in order to provide a more customized Firefox experience.</li>
          <li>As you would expect, we do not collect any information when you are in private browsing mode.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>You help make Firefox better</h2>
          <p>At Mozilla, we pride ourselves on building products for you, the user! That’s why we need your help.  You help us by letting us observe how you use new features and by telling us your opinions about them.</p>
          <p>By participating in this study, you will help us make better decisions on your behalf and directly shape the future of Firefox.</p>
